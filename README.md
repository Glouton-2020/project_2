# Customer Relationship Management Website

======================================================
## Concept: 
=======================================================

For this project, I created a full CRUD CRM application using the technologies outlined below. I thought of creating the app as a useful tool for my sales team to use in their client outreach. Although the application is far from being considered a viable customer relationship management system, it is fun to use and able to keep users on track with their customer relations. 

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap 4
- JavaScript
- React
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Heroku
- Font Awesome
- Unsplash
- Giphy

## Approach: 
I started by initializing all the file structures then created my express app, server.js and installed all of the dependencies. 
After I wrote down the basic routes needed and developed the schema for my database. 

I first made the schema challenging with various questions to answer, after running into issues i revisited this method and made a simple schema of just 4 questions. Next I created my Index, Show and Default view, including Bootstrap to have basic styling. 
I built out my routes one by one building down to the delete route. My wireframe was created during class time, however with the issues i ran into i diverged away from the wireframe and free flowed the layout decisions. Overall i'm happy with the way it came out. 

## Challenges / ## Unsolved Problems

1) I wanted to use a radio dropdown button and limit the choices when selecting industry so that i could then display 3 cards on the index page users would click to take them to a new page of clients from that industry. Going this route meant rewriting my code. Instead i opted to display all created clients on the index page and use a table to convey the essential information and have a column to show if that client has been contacted or not. 
2) I would like to add pictures to each company in the future and get a working search bar alongside pages when the table gets too long. 
3) There were a couple problems on the way of getting edit and show to fix, however with a little help from class members i was able to get this fixed and moved onto organizing and styling the CRM.
